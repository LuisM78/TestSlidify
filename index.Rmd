## Here is an example of how the data looks like ##



```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
# Scripts\shinyproject\data
# C:\Users\Luis Miguel\Google Drive\Data Specialization JHU\DevelopingDataProducts\Scripts\shinyproject\data
setwd("C:/Users/Luis Miguel/Google Drive/Data Specialization JHU/DevelopingDataProducts/Scripts/shinyproject/data")
datanames <- read.csv("dow_jones_index.names")
data <- read.csv("dow_jones_index.data")
head(data,5)
#summary(data)
```
